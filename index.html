                    <p>Let's suppose that you were able everynight<br> To dream any dream you wanted to dream.<br>
                    Naturally when you began on this adventure of <br>Dreams you would fulfill all your wishes.<br>
                    You would have every kind of pleasure that you could concieve.<br> After several nights you would say ''well, that was pretty great''</p>

                    Something is going to happen to me <br>And i don't know what it is gonna be.<br>
                    Then you'd get more and more adventurous<br> And you would make further and further outgambles<br> As to what you would dream of.<br> 'Til finally you would dream of where you are now.</p>
